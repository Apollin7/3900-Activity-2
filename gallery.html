         <p>The nature around us offers such marvelous, sensational and romantic sights, that are worth traveling to visit.
             Like the woman in the picture above, or the man looking at the sunset in the picture below,I like to travel to discover nature.
             Some important places I would like to visit are: the Machu Picchu in Peru, the Grand Canyon in Arizona, the Angel Falls in Venezuela,
             the Na Pali Coast in Hawaii and more. Travelling can help people make memorable memories, forget about their daily troubles,
             or even meet new people and mingle with them. So, one simple advice: travel as possible as you can and you will feel refreshed.
